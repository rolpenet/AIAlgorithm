Search plays a major role in solving many Artificial Intelligence (AI) problems. Search is a universal problem-solving mechanism in AI. In many problems, sequence of steps required to solve is not known in advance but must be determined by systematic trial-and-error exploration of alternatives. 
The problems that are addressed by AI search algorithms fall into three general classes:
•	single-agent path-finding problems, 
•	playing games, 
•	constraint-satisfaction problems

Single-agent path-finding problems
Often a problem can be formulated as a pathfinding problem in which the solution is represented by a series of actions that make the transition from the initial state to the goal state. Classic examples in the AI literature of path-finding problems are sliding-title puzzles, Rubik’s Cube and theorem proving. Real-world problems include the traveling salesman problem, vehicle navigation. 

Game playing
Adversarial search problems (a.k.a.games) are Problems in which we have two or more agents and each one tries to maximize its outcome. 

Constraint-satisfaction problems. Are problems where the desired state has to meet a number of restrictions. Real-world examples of constraint satisfaction problems are planning and scheduling applications.
