Protege is a free, java-based, open-source platform which provides tools to construct domain models and knowledge-based applications 
with ontologies [1]. it has numerous plug-in to extend the functionality of the application.

* hardware/software resources
- it can be installed on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
- is available as a downloadable archive that can also include JRE (Java Runtime Environment); in the case of version 5.5.0
for Windows, the archive has a size of 117 MB, reaching after unpacking to 218 MB. No installation required.
- the memory used is limited to 444 MB. 

* suport pentru import/export 
- offers the ability to import ontologies in various formats from disk or web or by specifying the URL.
- the export of ontology can be done in several formats: RDF / XML, Turtle, OWL / XML, OWL Functional, Manchester OWL, OBO, LaTex, Jason-
LD
- it also offers support for conversion between different formats. For example, you can import a file in RDF / XML format and then export it to Turtle format. 

* support for graphical visualization
- OntoGraf offers visualizations in several forms with the possibility of exporting as a picture or as a DOT.
- has a number of plug-in for various other views that can be saved as an image. 

* support for reasoning
- has a preinstalled reasoner (HermiT) but other reasoners can also be used (plug-in for Pellet, Fact++, RacerPro).
HermiT uses direct semantics and passes all OWL 2 conforman direct semantics reasoners[3]. 
- verifies the consistency of ontology and extracts by inference other relationships between classes. 
- the reasoner can start or stop. If it is turned on, it will check if the ontology is consistent.

* support for queries 
- there are three possibilities for querying ontology: DL query, existential query, SPARQL query. 
- se pot face interogari in SQWRL care is an extension of OWL/SWRL. 

* other facilities
- it can generate documentation in HTML format.
- it can generate java code with classes and properties from ontology
- many plug-ins are available, some can be installed directly from the application, others can be downloaded and copied to the plug-in directory of the application

* usability
> creating an ontology
- when creating an ontology, it first establishes the IRI address of ontology with the ability to specify the version of ontology.
- In terms of adding prefixes, the application helps us by providing a list with the most used prefixes (owl, rdf, rdfs, xml, xsd)
with the possibility of deleting or adding prefixes. 
- in the same view, annotations can also be passed (creator of ontology, ontology version, compatibility with other versions, license information)

> creating classes
- surprises by intuitive way of creating / adding classes and subclasses.  
- select a class and use one of the options - add a class on the same level, a subclass, or delete the class.
- you can directly create a hierarchy of classes using indentation, one class per row, so you can build a classification without knowledge in ontology.


> adding object properties 


>importing an ontology 
TO DO

>reasoning 
- Pentru a face inferente si a verifica consistenta ontologiei reasonerul trebuie pornit. Pentru relatiile inferate sau pentru inconsistenta ontologiei, reasonerul ofera posibilitatea vizualizarii deductiilor utilizate.
- Pnetru a lua in calcul modificarile efectuate asupra ontologiei, exista optiunea de sincronizare. Se pot configura si tipurile de inferente afisate.
- Am testat si posibilitatea de a utiliza si un alt reasoner - de exmplu am instalat pluginul pentru Pellet si l-am selectat din meniu ca reasoner. 

>altele
-Protege also offers a number of metrics - the number of axioms, classes, subclasses, properties, subproperties.


- uneori se blocheaza



- de trecut la capitolul limbaje de interogare. 
SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is an expressive OWL-based rule language. de vazut ce e cu el ????[2]
