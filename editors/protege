Protege is a free, java-based, open-source platform which provides tools to construct domain models and knowledge-based applications 
with ontologies [1]. it has numerous plug-in to extend the functionality of the application.

* hardware/software resources
- it can be installed on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
- is available as a downloadable archive that can also include JRE (Java Runtime Environment); in the case of version 5.5.0
for Windows, the archive has a size of 117 MB, reaching after unpacking to 218 MB. No installation required.
- the memory used is limited to 444 MB. 

* suport pentru import/export 
- offers the ability to import ontologies in various formats from disk or web or by specifying the URL.
- the export of ontology can be done in several formats: RDF / XML, Turtle, OWL / XML, OWL Functional, Manchester OWL, OBO, LaTex, Jason-
LD
- it also offers support for conversion between different formats. For example, you can import a file in RDF / XML format and then export it to Turtle format. 

* support for graphical visualization
- OntoGraf offers visualizations in several forms with the possibility of exporting as a picture or as a DOT.
- has a number of plug-in for various other views that can be saved as an image. 

* support for reasoning
- has a preinstalled reasoner (HermiT) but other reasoners can also be used (plug-in for Pellet, Fact++, RacerPro).
HermiT uses direct semantics and passes all OWL 2 conformance tests for direct semantics reasoners[3].
- verifies the consistency of ontology and extracts by inference other relationships between classes. 
- the reasoner can start or stop. If it is turned on, it will check if the ontology is consistent.

* support for queries 
- there are three possibilities for querying ontology: DL query, existential query, SPARQL query. 
- query possibilities can be extended - by installing a plug-in, you can use SQWRL for quering which is an extension of OWL / SWRL. 

* other facilities
- it can generate documentation in HTML format.
- it can generate java code with classes and properties from ontology
- many plug-ins are available, some can be installed directly from the application, others can be downloaded and copied to the plug-in directory of the application

* usability
> creating an ontology
- when creating an ontology, it first establishes the IRI address of ontology with the ability to specify the version of ontology.
- In terms of adding prefixes, the application helps us by providing a list with the most used prefixes (owl, rdf, rdfs, xml, xsd)
with the possibility of deleting or adding prefixes. 
- in the same view, annotations can also be passed (creator of ontology, ontology version, compatibility with other versions, license information)

> creating classes
- surprises by intuitive way of creating / adding classes and subclasses.  
- select a class and use one of the options - add a class on the same level, a subclass, or delete the class.
- you can duplicate a class and modify it.
- you can directly create a hierarchy of classes using indentation, one class per row, so you can build a classification without knowledge in ontology.
- in the annotation view can be made a description of the class. The application provides several owl and rdfs items for this purpose.

> adding object properties 
- you can choose the domain and range with access to the class hierarchy.
- you can check the characteristics of the property: functional, transitive, symmetric, etc.
- you can specify certain properties - Equivalent With, SubProperty Of, Disjoint With, Inverse Of

> adding data properties
-  resembles object properties - you can specify scope and range, with the difference that at range you can choose the data type from a predefined list or you can enter expressions.

> adding individuals
- you can choose the type in the hierarchy of classes, you can add object property assertion and date property assertion.

>importing an ontology
TO DO

> reasoning
- to make inferencies and check the consistency of the ontology, the reasoner must be started. For infered relationships or inconsistency of ontology, the reasoner provides the possibility to visualize the deductions used.
- To take into account changes made to ontology, there is a synchronization option. You can also configure the types of inferences displayed.
- Am testat si posibilitatea de a utiliza si un alt reasoner - de exmplu am instalat pluginul pentru Pellet si l-am selectat din meniu ca reasoner. 
- I also tested the possibility to use another reasoner - for example I installed the Pellet plugin and selected it from the menu as a reasoner

> querying
- querying requires knowledge of the Manchester syntax or the SPARQL language.
- DL query uses Manchester Syntax to query ontology with the possibility to add results to ontology. You can query superclasses, equivalent classes, subclasses, and instances.
- SPARQL query - you find here the most common prefixes and the SELECT skeleton with a WHERE clause, which facilitates the query.    

> visualization
- in Protege default visualization tool is OntoGraf that provides a image of classes and their relationships;
In OntoGraf, the classes of interest are added by doubleclick on the class of the class hierarchy. With various mouse actions, you can see details about a particular class, the relationship between two classes, you can add subclasses and superclasses to a selected class.
You can choose the layout of the graphic elements in space (radial, spring, tree horizontal, tree vertical etc.). The graph can be saved as an image, including as a DOT (graph description language).

> others
- Protege also offers a number of metrics - the number of axioms, classes, subclasses, properties, subproperties.
- export option OWLDoc creates and exports documentation as HTML files that can be viewed in a browser.
- there is an option to generates Java code for each class
- refactoring - you can rename a class, move a class with all subclasses by drag and drop, rename an IRI.

- de trecut la capitolul limbaje de interogare. 
SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is an expressive OWL-based rule language. de vazut ce e cu el ????[2]

webprotege

> hardware/software resources
- only a web browser, email account, and internet access is required

> suport pentru import/export
- import ontology - you can import ontologies by providing a URL or a local zip archive

- history with modificarile efectuate

> usability
- UI este organizat pe tabs cele mai importante fiind clasele, proprietatile, individuals, query. La majoritatea box de completat, aplicatia vine cu sugestii pe masura ce incepi sa scrii, ceea ce usureaza munca si evita posibilele erori de scriere. De asemenea aplicatia este gandita sa se plieze pe fluxurile utilizate de utilizatori pentru crearea diverselor elemente ale ontologiei - in functie de stilul de lucru, clasele, proprietatile si indivizii pot fi creati in diverse moduri.  

> creating an ontology
- you can create an ontology from scratch or from existing sources.

> creating classes
- se poate completa denumirea clasei, annotation(se pot alege dintr-o lista presatbilitat cele mai frecvente)
- se pot trece superclasele (parents) sau proprietatile (relationship). Daca proprietatile nu exista, le creaza. La fel daca clasa la caree face referire proprietatea nu exista, o creaza. 
- clasele se pot adauga, muta sau sterge 

> adding object properties
- se poate trece denumirea proprietatii, annotations, domain si range
- proprietatile se pot adauga, muta sau sterge

> adding data properties
- se poate trece denumirea proprietatii, annotations, domain si range
- se poate bifa daca proprietarea este sau nu functionala
- proprietatile se pot adauga, muta sau sterge
- daca clasa la care face referire (domeniul) sau tipul de data (range) nu exista, aplicatia cu acordul utilizatorului le creaza.  

> adding individuals
- pentru stabilirea tipului unui individ sunt date mai multe variante : daca am creat o clasa si vrem sa-i adaugam indivizi folosim butonul Sync Selection; daca adaugam ulterior indivizii, putem adauga tipul din ierarhia de clase. Mai sunt si variantele: jump to parent, jump to child, jump to sibling sau putem cauta clasa.  

> importing an ontology
- pentru a importa o ontologie stocata pe disk trebuie sa furnizam o arhiva zip cu un document numit root-ontology.owl

> querying
- 

> visualization

> others
- sharing - se poate stabili o lista cu users care pot accesa ontologia si ce actiuni pot face: view, comment or edit.
