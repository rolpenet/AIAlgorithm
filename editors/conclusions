The editors studied were designed for different purposes, address different user categories, and have different characteristics. Some address beginners and emphasize the graphical side and ease of creating and modifying simple ontologies. Others address specialists, are built for more complex ontologies, have more facilities and have a wider range of applications.
For beginners and those who are familiar with UML diagrams and object-oriented programming that intends to make a simple ontology, OWLGrEd is the most appropriate editor. It is based on graphical diagrams in UML style, classes, object and data properties, individuals and class relationships are built through graphical elements. The emphasis on the graphic is also reflected in the view mode. In it you can set the colors, the font, the shapes, the spatial layout. An ontology can be created in Protege and imported into OWLGrEd to get a great visualization, especially for large ontologies. The resulting graph can then be saved in several formats including SVG for web pages.
For ontologies worked in team the ideal editor is webprotege. This, besides taking over many of the Protege facilities, has the advantage that ontology can be accessed online. It means that you can modify the ontology from many places, shared with other in the github style with rights set for each user.
