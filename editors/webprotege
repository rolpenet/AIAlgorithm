> usability
- UI is organized on tabs, the most important being classes, properties, individuals, query. At most boxes, the application comes with suggestions as you start writing, making it easy to work and avoid possible writing errors. Also, the application is intended to follow the flows used by users to create various elements of ontology - Depending on the style of work, classes, properties, and individuals can be created in different ways.  

> creating an ontology
- you can create an ontology from scratch or from existing sources.

> creating classes
- it is possible to fill in the name of the class, annotation (you can choose from a most frequently used preset list)
- we can override superclasele (parents) or properties (relationship). If the properties do not exist, it creates them. Similarly, if the class to which the property refers does not exist, it creates it. 
- classes can be added, moved or deleted

> adding object properties
- you can pass the property name, annotations, domain and range
- properties can be added, moved or deleted

> adding data properties
- you can pass the property name, annotations, domain and range
- you can check whether the property is functional or not
- properties can be added, moved or deleted
- if the class that it refers to (domain) or the type of range does not exist, the application with the user's consent creates them.

> adding individuals
- to determine the type of an individual are given several variants: if we created a class and we want to add individuals we use the Sync Selection button; if we add individuals later, we can add the type from the hierarchy of classes. There are also variants: jump to parent, jump to child, jump to sibling or we can search for class.

> importing an ontology
- to import an ontology stored on disk we must provide a zip archive with a document called root-ontology.owl

> querying
- 

> visualization

> others
- sharing - you can set up a list of users who can access ontology and what actions they can do: view, comment or edit.
