Ontologies can be expressed using different syntaxes:
 - functional-style syntax - is generally used by OWL tools designers for specifications.
 - RDF/XML - although it's difficult to read by people, is the only syntax that has to be supported by OWL tools.
 - Manchester syntax - is a much easier to read and write representation, and aims to use it in editing ontologies in class expression from various OWL tools.[7]
 - Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle) - is a series of triple semantics: subject - predicate - object, widely used by owl tools.
 - Jason-LD - is based on Json format and tries to encompass in this Linked Data format.[8]
 - OBO format - is a popular ontology file format. It can express a subset of the description logic language OWL-DL 2.0 but in addition has standard syntax for representing important classes of meta-data including as synonyms, references to publications and deprecated IDs. It is designed to be human readable and editable, easy to parse, easy to extend and to have minimal redundancy[6]
 - LaTeX is a document preparation system, based on TeX. Ontologies may be serialized in LaTeX for ease of reading, publication, etc.[1]
