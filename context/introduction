Introducere

The World Wide Web is in a continuous evolution. If at the beginning (Web 1.0) it were only aiming to publish the data, we currently (Web 3.0) talk about web semantics. Until recently, the focus has been on finding information (search engine), on users contributing and interacting with web content (blog and social platforms), the focus has now been on enhancing metadata data that adds significance to existing data. it is intended that WWW to be a provider of information and not just data. In this regard, it is necessary that the data gathered from different locations be easily understood by the software agents.
To achieve this goal, a standardized representation of knowledge is required. Ontology is a way of representing knowledge. There are many tools for creating, editing, and viewing ontologies, and it is a question of choosing the most appropriate tool for the ontology according to the complexity of ontology and user-owned knowledge. 
The aim of this study is to provide a comparative view of the best known free tools for editing ontologies. Such comparative studies have been made in the past, but in view of the continuous evolution of the instruments, comparative studies are required periodically.
For this comparison, in order to evaluate each tool, I have created a demonstrating ontology that attempts to model artificial intelligence algorithms, and I imported a existing ontology. Demonstrative ontology is described in Chapter 3. Editing tools and evaluation criteria are listed in Chapter 4. The evaluation tools are extensively analyzed in Chapter 5.
